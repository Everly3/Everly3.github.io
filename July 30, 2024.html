        <h3 class="bigtext" style="color:rgb(139, 174, 255);">One of my favorite things about mexican restuarants is they always serve the best appetizer. Chips and salsa! Each restaurant has their own recipe, whether the salsa is red or green, spicy or mild. Finding salsa at a mexican restaurant that you enjoy and snacking on it befoe the meal is something special only mexican restaurants have. Now it's time for the thing you've all been waiting for, the recommendations. These restaurants are not chain restaurants currently. My first recommendation is Fernando's chips and salsa. The salsa is a touch on the spicier side, but it tastes amazing. 5 stars, for sure. Fernandos salsa tastes fresh, way better than store salsa. This is my opinion, not yours, do not let me influence how much you like Fernando's salsa and chips. If you like mexican food and chips and salsa, then Fernando's chips and salsa is for you. Note: Fernandos is located in Chicago, Illinios. A picture of Fernando's salsa is below.</h3>

    <h3 class="bigtext" style="color:rgb(139, 174, 255);">My second and final recommendation of the day is for Don Pedro's salsa, specifically their green salsa. It tastes like it was made with with guacomole, very fresh, not spicy, and great for kids. It is good to top Don Pedro's main meals, such as fajitas and tacos. 5 stars, highly recommend. A picture of Don Pedros salsa is below. Don pedros is located in Chicago, Illinios.</h3>
