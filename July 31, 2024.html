       <h3 class="bigtext" style="color:rgb(139, 174, 255);">Ice cream time! I will be recommending ice cream shops. Ice cream is a great treat after meals and is extremely fun to get with family and friends. There are so many different flavors that you can get in cups or cones, with or without toppings. Some of the most popular ice cream flavors are choclate, butter pecan, cookies & cream, vanilla, mint chip, neapolitan, strawberry, choclate chip cookie dough, and rocky road. Now for the ice cream shop recommendations. My first and final recommendation of the day is Teddy's ice cream shop. It has a very cheerful interior and exterior with a large collection of delicios ice cream flavors. They have a size of cup for the whole family, with a kid's size, a single scoop, and a double scoop. For those who prefer cones, they have sugar, waffle and cake cones with options of cones with chocolte around the rim. They also have soft serves and the optoin to get then dipped in a couple of different flavors. They also have greek pastries and desserts. They several gluten free and vegan options. They a large amount of toppings to choose from, including, sprinkles, marshmallows, gummy bears, and more. 5 stars. An image of Teddy's is below. Teddy's ice cream is located in Chicago, Illinois.</h3>
